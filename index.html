            <h2>What is Gunpla?</h2>
            <p>Gunpla, short for "Gundam Plastic Models," are highly detailed model kits produced by Bandai. These kits allow hobbyists to construct scale models of Mobile Suits from the Gundam anime franchise. Unlike traditional model kits, most Gunpla are snap-fit and do not require glue.</p>

        <section id="history">
            <h2>History of Gunpla</h2>
            <p>The first Gunpla kits were introduced in 1980, following the success of the original <em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em> series. Initially requiring glue, early kits evolved into snap-fit models in the 1990s, making the hobby more accessible. Over the years, Bandai has continued to innovate, releasing new grades, enhanced articulation, and improved details.</p>

            <h2>The Process of Building Gunpla</h2>
            <p>Building a Gunpla model kit involves multiple steps to achieve the best result:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Nub Removal</h3>
            <p>Parts are cut from plastic runners using nippers, and remaining plastic nubs are smoothed out using a hobby knife or sanding tools.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Panel Lining</h3>
            <p>Fine-tip markers or washes are used to add depth to panel lines, enhancing the model's realism.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Decals and Stickers</h3>
            <p>Most kits include either stickers, dry transfers, or water-slide decals to enhance the appearance of the finished model.</p>

            <h3>4. Painting</h3>
            <p>Paint can be used to modify colors, add shading, or create battle damage for a more dynamic look.</p>

            <h3>5. Topcoat</h3>
            <p>A final topcoat (matte, semi-gloss, or gloss) is applied to protect the paint and decals while giving the model a consistent finish.</p>

            <h2>My Next Build</h2>
            <p>I am excited to build the <strong>MG 1/100 Gouf</strong> Gunpla kit next. This kit stands out due to its unique design, curved armor pieces, and detailed articulation. I plan to add panel lining and possibly some custom paintwork to enhance its appearance.</p>
